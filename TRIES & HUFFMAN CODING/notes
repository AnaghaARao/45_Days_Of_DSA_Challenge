- Advantage of utilizing a trie data structure instead of a hashmap:
    1. tries exhibit higher memory efficiency compared to hashmap
    2. tries demonstrate efficiency in prefix search operations

- in the trie data structure, every node can have a max of 26 addreses/ child node
- the address should also be of the type of trieClass
